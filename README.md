Data from Kaggle:
www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

Description: U.S. traffic accident analysis. This includes data exploration, accident severity prediction through random forest, and K-means clustering to find hotspots. The visualization folder includes the D3 front-end webpage developed from the analysis.

Installation:
To run the visualization, start with the file called States_visualization. From the webpage, you can explore more of the map by clicking on the states listed on the legend. On each of the state map, you can explore the top five counties with the most accidents by hovering over and clicking on them. When you are on any of the county webpage, you can use the three buttons on the bottom of the page to get more insights from the county's traffic accident data. We can navigate back from any page by simply clicking the back buttom from your web browser.  

Accident Clustering is run using the file Clustering_CountyWide.ipynb. The notebook will use the Accident_Count_Per_Top10County & State.csv file as data source. After clustering, it would also give latitute and longitude of numbered cluster centers and saved in the file Centers.csv for further visualization.
